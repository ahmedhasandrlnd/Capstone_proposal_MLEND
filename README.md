### Domain Background

<p> There are thousands of different dog breeds in the world. Some of these dog breeds are two close to differentiate from their images For example, the above two dogs seem to belong to the same breed. But, the left one is Norfolk Terrier, and the right one Norwich Terrier.  With the advancement of technology, computers are getting enough intelligent to distigush different classes of objects from their images. Since 2010, the ImageNet project runs an annual software contest, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes useing one thousand non-overlapping classes [1]. In this capstone project, I want to leverage the state of art of image classification model on Imagenet to teach computer to predict 133 dog's breed from an image using deep learning algorithms.
